Code Smells 🦨

🐘🐘 Bloaters 🐘🐘
A lot of code in a method/class -> accumulates over time

Long Method > 10 lines
💊 Treatment 
-> if you feel the need to comment on something inside a method, 
you should take this code and put it in a new method.

🙅🏻🙅🏻 Object-Orientation Abusers 🙅🏻🙅🏻
All these smells are incomplete or incorrect application of object-oriented programming principles.

Switch
💊 Treatment 
As a rule of thumb, when you see switch you should think of polymorphism.

Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
Two classes perform identical functions but have different method names.
💊 Treatment 
If only part of the functionality of the classes is duplicated, try using Extract Superclass.
In this case, the existing classes will become subclasses.
