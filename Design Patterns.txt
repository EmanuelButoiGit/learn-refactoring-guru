😋 an algorithm 😋
is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. 


🏠 A pattern 🏠
is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

🧐 When a solution gets repeated over and over in various projects, 
someone eventually puts a name to it and describes the solution in detail. 
That’s basically how a pattern gets discovered.


🟢 Classification of patterns

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms 🐵🙈🙉. 
They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns 😎😎😎. 
Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. 
Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.


3️⃣ main groups of patterns:

⚙️ Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that 
    -> increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

🏠 Structural patterns explain 
    -> how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, 
    while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

✉️ Behavioral patterns 
    -> take care of effective communication
    and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
