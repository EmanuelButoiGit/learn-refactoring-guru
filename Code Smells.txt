Code Smells 🦨

🐘🐘 Bloaters 🐘🐘
A lot of code in a method/class -> accumulates over time

Long Method > 10 lines
💊 Treatment 
-> if you feel the need to comment on something inside a method, 
you should take this code and put it in a new method.


🙅🏻🙅🏻 Object-Orientation Abusers 🙅🏻🙅🏻
All these smells are incomplete or incorrect application of object-oriented programming principles.

Switch
💊 Treatment 
As a rule of thumb, when you see switch you should think of polymorphism.

Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
Two classes perform identical functions but have different method names.
💊 Treatment 
If only part of the functionality of the classes is duplicated, try using Extract Superclass.
In this case, the existing classes will become subclasses.


📋📋 Change Preventers 📋📋
These smells mean that if you need to change something in one place in your code, you have to make many changes in other places too. Program development becomes much more complicated and expensive as a result.

Divergent Change
You find yourself having to change many unrelated methods when you make changes to a class. 
REASON copypasta programming
💊 Treatment 
Split up the behavior of the class via Extract Class.

🔫 Shotgun Surgery
REASON overzealous application of Divergent Change.


🗑️🗑️ Dispensables 🗑️🗑️
A dispensable is something pointless and unneeded whose absence would make the code cleaner, more efficient and easier to understand.

Comments
A method is filled with explanatory comments.

Duplicate Code

😴 Lazy Class
Understanding and maintaining classes always costs time and money. So if a class doesn’t do enough to earn your attention, it should be deleted.
💊 Treatment 
Inline Class (combine classes), Collapse Hierarchy


🐫🐫 Couplers 🐫🐫
All the smells in this group contribute to excessive coupling between classes or show what happens if coupling is replaced by excessive delegation.

Inappropriate Intimacy
One class uses the internal fields and methods of another class.
💊 Treatment 
The simplest solution is to use Move Method and Move Field to move parts of one class to the class in which those parts are used. But this works only if the first class truly doesn’t need these parts.

Middle Man
If a class performs only one action, delegating work to another class, why does it exist at all?
💊 Treatment 
If most of a method’s classes delegate to another class, Remove Middle Man is in order.
