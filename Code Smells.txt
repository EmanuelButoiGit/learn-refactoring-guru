Code Smells 🦨

🐘🐘 Bloaters 🐘🐘
A lot of code in a method/class -> accumulates over time

Long Method > 10 lines
💊 Treatment 
-> if you feel the need to comment on something inside a method, 
you should take this code and put it in a new method.


🙅🏻🙅🏻 Object-Orientation Abusers 🙅🏻🙅🏻
All these smells are incomplete or incorrect application of object-oriented programming principles.

Switch
💊 Treatment 
As a rule of thumb, when you see switch you should think of polymorphism.

Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
Two classes perform identical functions but have different method names.
💊 Treatment 
If only part of the functionality of the classes is duplicated, try using Extract Superclass.
In this case, the existing classes will become subclasses.


📋📋 Change Preventers 📋📋
These smells mean that if you need to change something in one place in your code, you have to make many changes in other places too. Program development becomes much more complicated and expensive as a result.

Divergent Change
You find yourself having to change many unrelated methods when you make changes to a class. 
REASON copypasta programming
💊 Treatment 
Split up the behavior of the class via Extract Class.

🔫 Shotgun Surgery
REASON overzealous application of Divergent Change.


🗑️🗑️ Dispensables 🗑️🗑️
A dispensable is something pointless and unneeded whose absence would make the code cleaner, more efficient and easier to understand.
